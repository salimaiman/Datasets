2,102,"They followed what the evil ones gave out (falsely) against the power of Solomon: the blasphemers Were, not Solomon, but the evil ones, teaching men Magic, and such things as came down at babylon to the angels Harut and Marut. But neither of these taught anyone (Such things) without saying: ""We are only for trial; so do not blaspheme."" They learned from them the means to sow discord between man and wife. But they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah's permission. And they learned what harmed them, not what profited them. And they knew that the buyers of (magic) would have no share in the happiness of the Hereafter. And vile was the price for which they did sell their souls, if they but knew!","['aqidah', 'kisah']"
2,103,"If they had kept their Faith and guarded themselves from evil, far better had been the reward from their Lord, if they but knew!","['aqidah', 'akhlak']"

2,113,"The Jews say: ""The Christians have naught (to stand) upon; and the Christians say: ""The Jews have naught (To stand) upon."" Yet they (Profess to) study the (same) Book. Like unto their word is what those say who know not; but Allah will judge between them in their quarrel on the Day of Judgment.","['aqidah', 'alam-akhirat']"
2,114,"And who is more unjust than he who forbids that in places for the worship of Allah, Allah's name should be celebrated?-whose zeal is (in fact) to ruin them?
